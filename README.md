# Number-Guessing-game
I made this number guessing game as an introduction project to my python carrer


I imported the random package as well as the os package, and after that I was able to create my variables, which were my total number of chances
the number to guess, wrong answers, my guess as well as list for the number of tries through a for loop.

In the for loop I took the user guess and checked if it was correct. If so, I sent a message saying, "Congratulations".

I then checked if the guess was higher than the number to guess, and gave a hint to the player, same theory for a lower guess than excpected.

I'm planning on adding an if and elif statemnt to check if the number is < 0, and/or > 10
